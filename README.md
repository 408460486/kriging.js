kriging.js
==========

**kriging.js** is a Javascript library providing spatial prediction and mapping capabilities via the ordinary kriging algorithm. 

Kriging is a type of gaussian process where 2-dimensional coordinates are mapped to some target variable using kernel regression. This algorithm has been specifically designed to accurately model smaller data sets by assmuming a set of bayesian priors on both the variogram parameters and the gaussian process.

Fitting a model
---------------

The first step is to link **kriging.js** to your html code and assign your coordinate and target variables to 3 separate arrays.

``` html
<script src="kriging.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
	var t = [ /* Target variable */ ];
	var x = [ /* X-axis coordinates */; ];
	var y = [ /* Y-axis coordinates */; ];
	var model = "exponential";
	var alpha = 100, beta = 1;
	var variogram = kriging.train(t, x, y, model, alpha, beta);
</script>
```

The train method in the kriging object fits your input to whatever variogram model you specify - gaussian, exponential or spherical - and returns a variogram object. 

Bayesian priors
---------------

Notice the alpha and beta variables, these correspond to the variance parameters of the gaussian priors of the variogram model and the gaussian process, respectively. A diffuse alpha prior (~100) and standard normal variance beta prior (1) is recommended; a formal mathematical explanation of the model is provided below.

Predicting new values
---------------------

Values can be predicted for new coordinate pairs by using the predict method in the kriging object.

``` javascript
  var xnew, ynew /* Pair of new coordinates to predict */;
  var tpredicted = kriging.predict(xnew, ynew, variogram);
  
```
